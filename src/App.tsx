        <p>
          This is a simple example of using Lenis with Framer Motion. The
          scrolling is handled by Lenis, while the animations are handled by
          Framer Motion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Scroll down to see the effect. The page will scroll smoothly, and the
          animations will be triggered as you scroll.
